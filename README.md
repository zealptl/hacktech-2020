# NoCoronaDiscrimination
Our application polls data from anonymous tippers and plots the locations submitted on the map. With this data, users can find out which areas are dangerous and can avoid them. Our app also has an educational component where we help educate people on this issue and give them tips as to how to avoid they can avoid confrontation.

It was developed by Bhavesh Shah, Zeal Patel, Jonathan Wong, and Kevin Yee for HackTech 2020.
